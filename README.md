# Data-Engineering-Solution-for-AdvertiseX-A-Case-Study
As a data engineer at AdvertiseX, you’ll need to design a robust and efficient data processing pipeline to handle the various data sources and formats. Let’s break down the requirements and propose a solution:

1. Data Ingestion
Ad Impressions (JSON):
Source: Ad impressions data is generated in JSON format.
Ingestion System:
Use a real-time streaming platform (e.g., Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis) to ingest ad impressions data.
Implement Kafka producers to publish ad impressions events.
Set up Kafka consumers to process the data in real-time.
For batch processing, periodically load historical data from storage (e.g., S3, HDFS).
Clicks and Conversions (CSV):
Source: Click and conversion data is logged in CSV format.
Ingestion System:
Use a batch processing system (e.g., Apache Spark, AWS Glue) to ingest CSV files.
Schedule regular batch jobs to process new CSV files.
Validate data integrity and handle any missing or malformed records.
Bid Requests (Avro):
Source: Bid request data is received in a semi-structured format (mostly Avro).
Ingestion System:
Use Avro schema registry (e.g., Confluent Schema Registry) to manage Avro schemas.
Ingest bid requests using Kafka or other streaming platforms.
Deserialize Avro data using the registered schema.
2. Data Processing
Standardization and Enrichment:
Normalize data across sources (e.g., user IDs, timestamps).
Enrich data by joining with reference tables (e.g., ad campaign details, user profiles).
Correlation:
Match ad impressions with clicks and conversions based on common identifiers (e.g., user ID, timestamp).
Calculate click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates.
3. Data Storage and Query Performance
Storage Solution:
Data Warehouse: Use a cloud-based data warehouse (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake).
Store processed data in structured tables.
Opt for columnar storage to improve query performance.
Indexing and Partitioning:
Create appropriate indexes on columns used for filtering and joining.
Partition tables by time (e.g., daily partitions) to optimize query performance.
4. Error Handling and Monitoring
Anomaly Detection:
Implement data quality checks (e.g., missing values, outliers).
Set up alerts for anomalies (e.g., sudden drops in impressions, high CTR).
Monitoring:
Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track system health.
Monitor data pipeline latency, throughput, and error rates.
Alerting:
Set up alerts for data discrepancies or delays.
Notify relevant teams when issues arise.
